# course-API

This is an Django application programming interface (API) that I will use with a front end application. I would also like to modify it to include a Student model and make a course management system.

## Todo:

1. Create a link between courses and degrees as outlined in import_models_from_calendar.py

2. Change the name of current Faculty model to Instructor or anything else and create a Faculty model to represent faculties like Science, Engineering, Art, etc. Also get data and import instances for the rest of the universities programs (or departments/schools).
